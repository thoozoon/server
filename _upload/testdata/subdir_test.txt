This is a test file located in a subdirectory.

It's used to verify that the upload client correctly handles file paths
by extracting just the base filename when uploading to the server.

When uploading this file with:
  go run upload_local.go testdata/subdir_test.txt

The client should:
1. Read the file from testdata/subdir_test.txt
2. Extract the base filename: subdir_test.txt
3. Upload to: /files/subdir_test.txt
4. Server should save it as: uploads/subdir_test.txt

This tests the filepath.Base() functionality in the modified client.
